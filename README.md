# Finite Element Analysis
This repo includes lecture notes and materials from my Finite Element Analysis (FEA) course. Note that this is an ongoing course and the readme will be updated throughout the semester. The goal is to have notes & study guides added weekly.

**Topics Include:**
- [Introduction to the Finite Element Method](https://github.com/leahgaeta/FEA/raw/master/Finite%20Element%20Method%20-%20Introduction.pdf)
- [The Stiffness (Displacement) Method](https://github.com/leahgaeta/FEA/raw/master/Stiffness%20%20(Displacement)%20Method.pdf)
